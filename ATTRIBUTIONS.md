## Joey De Vries, Learn OpenGL

While none of this code is a direct copy the original code of Learn OpenGL, it is all based on it though written in Haxe and GLSL. And none of it could have been written without this book.

I've used the following artifacts under https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL/blob/master/LICENSE.md:
   * metal.png (unmodified) for the floor.
   * grass.png (unmodified) for the simple transparency example.
   * window.png (unmodified) for the blending example.
