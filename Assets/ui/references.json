        "description": "The Rubik's cube model is a very simple construction of 9 smaller cubes. The code involves the use of VBOs, matrix operations to scale, rotate and translate. The shaders are very simple drawing a single color between the vertices, the only complication being the construction of the black border. The mouse and keyboard controls include the ability to rotate the cube or the camera, to move the camera around the scene, and to zoom in or out. There is no lighting in the mode. The entire first part of the book is used to build this model and scene.",

The normal data is already in the Cube.hx but in the book it is added in Ch 13. Specular values can be adjusted resulting hot spots or varying intensity and size. A simple texture of the OpenFL logo on a Rubik's color background is used.",

There are a number of controls in the demo to alter the material and light colors. There is reference material in DeVries which can be used to simulate specific materials. Strange effects can be created by creating lights with very different diffuse and specular colors.",

And while putting them all together in one scene is left to chapter 17 of DeVries, here I have them combined. \n\nThe concept and simulation of attenuation is introduced here also. Independent sliders for attenuation constants are provided. Strictly this is probably incorrect as it enables creation of light attenuation not naturally seen. In 16.3.1 of DeVries there is a table of constants that can be used as a guide.\n\nInitially with only a flashlight the scene is almost invisible.",
